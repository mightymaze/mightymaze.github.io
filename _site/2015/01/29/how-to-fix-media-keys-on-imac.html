<p>At first the media keys worked well with my iTunes. I was happy, but one day it stopped working with iTunes. I was confused. The keyboard was perfect. I realized the problem.</p>

<p>It’s not the iTunes or keyboard, it’s the Google Chrome and it’s Play Music app. After installing the Google Play Music app on my Google Chrome, the media keys were bound to the Music app only. So any other application can no longer get the media keys when Google Chrome is opened.</p>

<p>The simple solution what I did is went to <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Extensions</strong> &gt; <strong>Keyboard Shortcuts</strong> in Google Chrome and unbound all media keys. Kept every keyboard shortcuts <strong>Not Set</strong>.</p>

<p>This simple fix saved my months of suffering. Now I can use media keys for iTunes again.</p>
